Plantastic is a web app developed by Choi Ching Lam, Miko Leung, Jasmin Chan, Cenis Chan for the HSMC Computing Competition. It is built with 4 languages; HTML, CSS, JS, Python. We used the Jquery framework to better the app interface. As forthe algorithm, we implemented an exhaustive search of up to P(17, 17) permutations to ensure that the most optimal route to stop by each POI is found.
